<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

The **Simple and Compound Interest Calculator** is a shell script-based application designed to perform essential financial computations directly from the terminal. Developed as part of the Operating System Laboratory coursework, this project demonstrates the power of shell scripting for mathematical logic, user interaction, and process control.

It provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface to calculate simple interest, compound interest, and total amounts based on user-defined principal, rate, and time parameters.

<!-- QUICK START -->
## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Bash Shell**: Version 4.0 or higher is recommended for optimal compatibility.
- **bc Utility**: The standard Unix arbitrary precision calculator utility (`bc`) must be installed for floating-point calculation.
- **Environment**: Compatible with any POSIX-compliant terminal, including Linux distributions, macOS, and Termux on Android.

### Deployment Manual

1. **Clone the Collection**  
   Retrieve the localized repository using the following Git command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/SIMPLE-AND-COMPOUND-INTEREST-CALCULATOR.git
   cd SIMPLE-AND-COMPOUND-INTEREST-CALCULATOR
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**  
   Ensure the script has the necessary execution permissions within your shell environment:
   ```bash
   chmod +x "Source Code/Simple_&_Compound_Interest_Calculator.sh"
   ```

3. **Execution**  
   Initialize the interactive terminal menu to begin financial calculations:
   ```bash
   bash "Source Code/Simple_&_Compound_Interest_Calculator.sh"
   ```
