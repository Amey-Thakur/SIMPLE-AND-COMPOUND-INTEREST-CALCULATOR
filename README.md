<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

The **Simple and Compound Interest Calculator** is a shell script-based application designed to perform essential financial computations directly from the terminal. Developed as part of the Operating System Laboratory coursework, this project demonstrates the power of shell scripting for mathematical logic, user interaction, and process control.

It provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface to calculate simple interest, compound interest, and total amounts based on user-defined principal, rate, and time parameters.
